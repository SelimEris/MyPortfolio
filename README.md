# CSE262 - Programming Languages - Fall 2023

This is a Rust program in which we are creating a parser and interpreter that will parse and interpret many different inputs in the Rust language. Use 'cargo test' to try out the program.

# EBNF Grammar

In this part, you must:

- Define the syntax of conditional expressions using EBNF. 
- Define the meaning of the symbols you use to express your grammar. 
- Provide three more examples each of valid and invalid expressions.

Expression = Term { ("+" | "-") Term } ;
Term       = Factor { ("*" | "/") Factor } ;
Factor     = Number | Boolean | Identifier | "(" Expression ")" | ConditionalExpression ;
ConditionalExpression = Expression ConditionalOperator Expression ;
ConditionalOperator = ">" | "<" | ">=" | "<=" | "==" | "!=" ;

Number     = digit { digit } ;
Boolean    = "true" | "false" ;
Identifier = letter { letter | digit } ;

Expression: An arithmetic expression consisting of terms.
Term: A part of an expression, can be a multiplication or division of factors.
Factor: The smallest unit in an expression ie: a number, boolean, identifier, or a nested expression.
ConditionalExpression: An expression that compares two expressions using a conditional operator.
ConditionalOperator: Operators for comparison such as greater than, less than, etc.

Valid Examples:
5 >= 3
x < 10
a == b + 2

Invalid Examples:
"hello" > 5
7 != true       
x < "world"    


## Part 2 - Parser

In this part, you must:

1. Modify the existing parser to support the new grammar rules you defined in Part 1. This will involve adding new parser node variants.
2. Implement the necessary parser combinators for conditional operators. 

Check Parser class

## Part 3 - Interpreter

In this part, you must:

1. Modify the existing interpreter to support the new parser nodes generated by your parser. 
2. Implement the necessary evaluation rules for conditional operators. 
3. Write at least three tests that demonstrates how your interpreter correctly evaluates your chosen feature. 
4. Ensure your interpreter returns informative error messages for invalid expressions or runtime errors.

Check Interpreter class
